Instructions to Install
---------------

To be able to view the metaverse, you need to follow these simple instructions:

 ```sh
git clone https://github.com/NewUser47/MetaBazaar.git  # Clone the repository.
npm install  # Install dependencies. This may take a while.
npm run dev  # Start the local development server.
```
With the server running, browse the metaverse at `http://localhost:8080`. Open another browser tab and point it to the same URL to see the other client/user.

MetaBazaar offers a multiuser experience where users can voice chat amongst each other while looking like themselves, as they can create a personalized avatar as per their wish(credits to the readyplayerme api service), while shopping for their choice of products. The bazaar will be ever expanding and we will be adding multiple stores with more of your favourite products with time. 

This project was made as a part of the Flipkart GRID 4.0 Software Development Track challenge.
We would like to thank flipkart for this amazing opportunity, allowing us to explore about such a vast and interesting field of VR/AR.
